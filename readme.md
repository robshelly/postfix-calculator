# Postfix Calculator

This project took a premade GUI for a simple calculator. I implemented a postfix
notation function whereby the calculator parses an input expression (infix
notation) as a postfix notation and displays it. It also displays the value of the
expression by evaluating the postfix expression using a stack.
